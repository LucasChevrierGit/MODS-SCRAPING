## StockX API
In ./JSON/query/*, only those 2 variables in header need to be changed :

"x-stockx-device-id": "14bdd41f-f2d3-4f59-8d4e-633b685771ee",
"x-stockx-session-id": "d637e4fb-5520-45b5-bc6c-392b1f8ca262"

Cookies are useless, and other header variable might be useless too

Need to inspect whatever page on stockX, in network fetch/XHR, get a query (named e in chrome) and retrieve this 2 variables using "copy as curl" and past into curlconverter.com


You can use the headerChange function from class queryHandling to change device and session id variables or simply change them manually for every json query you will be using

If at some point an error message appear in your CLI, because of a negative query response (" Wrong status code for XXX, might be a problem with the authorization variable in headers. Check on stockX.com if there is a capcha. type "yes" to retry"). You might want to look for a capcha in the stockX website (reload the page if no captcha is visible - they ask you to click on a button to check you are not a bot). Doing that allows you to keep sending query with the same ids, otherwise, you'll have to change them.
